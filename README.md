**What about is this app?**
<br />
A dating application . It has implemented Real Time Chatting with users , Matching functionallity , User interface , Facebook Login (registration) , Filtering profiles.
<br />

**Why i did it?**
<br />
Well my main goal was to dive more in to backend and dbs and look at the websockets . This project was challenging because I had never implemented a
SQL based DB project .I had to spend a while learning about SQL
and how to set up a schema ,tables and writing raw queries. Also
I had not deep knowledge of auth sessions, oath and web sockets.
By implementing Facebook login , real time chat app it helped me
to understand how things work together. It was also very
challenging to deploy the project , it took me a while to import the
local .sql file to Heroku, and realized that using free hosting version
of Heroku is quite limited . Was difficult also to deal with CORS errors and warnings and i learned about SSL certificates too.
